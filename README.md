# Loan Default Prediction

## Project Overview

The **Loan Default Prediction** 
    project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. 
    The project leverages financial data such as credit score, loan amount, income, and employment status to build a robust model 
    capable of identifying high-risk borrowers. This predictive model helps financial institutions make informed lending decisions and 
    mitigate financial losses.

## Why Loan Default Prediction is Crucial for Financial Companies?

Loan default prediction is vital for financial companies because it helps them:

- **Minimize Risk:** By accurately predicting the probability of default, financial institutions can reduce the number of non-performing loans.
- **Improve Decision-Making:** Predictive models enable data-driven decisions, ensuring loans are granted to borrowers who are likely to repay.
- **Optimize Loan Approval Processes:** The model enhances operational efficiency by automating part of the loan approval workflow, reducing human error, and increasing scalability.
- **Enhance Customer Experience:** Offering personalized loan terms based on predicted risk can increase borrower satisfaction and trust.

## Project Details

This project utilizes an **AWS SageMaker Pipeline**, which is used for the entire lifecycle of the model, 
including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. A key feature of the pipeline is the integration 
of **manual approval from the project owner**, ensuring that the model meets quality standards and aligns with business 
objectives before final deployment.

## Key Features:

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline:** From data processing to model training, evaluation, and deployment, the entire workflow is automated with SageMaker Pipelines.
- **Manual Approval Process:** The project owner is involved in approving the model at each stage of the lifecycle, ensuring transparency and collaboration.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Leveraging AWS infrastructure for scalable and reliable model training and deployment.
